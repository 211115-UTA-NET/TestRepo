If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
. . .
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do
. . .
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time, ohh baby
