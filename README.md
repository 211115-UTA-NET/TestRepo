my mind is blowing

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground







If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that have hurt you
. . .
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me
Like you used to do
. . .
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time, ohh baby
